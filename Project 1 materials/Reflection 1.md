## Reflection for Project 1

### Investigating Delivery Robot Implementation and Challenges

Before delving into the design process, I would begin by investigating potential areas where delivery robots could be implemented effectively. This includes analyzing various use cases and environments to understand the needs they can address. Once implementation opportunities are identified, I would shift focus to investigating potential challenges, such as user acceptance, accessibility, and technical limitations, to ensure the design process is both relevant and comprehensive.

### Initial Idea

My initial idea was to design a robot delivery system focused on transferring documents within the university, connecting students, teachers, and administrative staff. The system would integrate with the existing online services portal, enabling secure document transfer. For instance, a professor needing a student’s signature on a consent form could upload the document, and the robot would deliver it to the student, or student needs a paper from SDU(for example: certificate from place of study) Access to the document would be restricted through an ID and password system, ensuring confidentiality and security. I believed this idea would streamline communication, save time, and reduce the reliance on physical intermediaries.

### Data Collection: Interviews

To gather relevant data, I would conduct interviews with at least three stakeholders, including students, faculty, and administrative staff. These interviews would be recorded in audio or video format to ensure detailed analysis later. The interview process would be designed to elicit in-depth responses rather than simple yes/no answers. For example, I would ask open-ended questions such as, “What challenges do you currently face with document handling at the university?” or “How do you envision a robot assisting you in your daily tasks?” This approach would provide insights into user experiences, needs, and expectations, which are critical for designing a user-centered solution.

### Sketching and Storyboarding a Design Solution

Using the insights gathered from interviews, I would sketch and storyboard a design solution that changes users’ mental models about what a delivery robot can do. For instance, I would explore features that make the robot more interactive and intuitive, such as a user-friendly interface for scheduling deliveries or notifications that guide users through the process. Storyboarding would help visualize the robot’s functionality and user interactions, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience.

### Evaluation and Feedback

To evaluate the effectiveness of my design solution, I would gather feedback through additional interviews and usability tests. This process would involve presenting the prototype to users and observing their interactions with it. The feedback collected would be used to refine the design further, addressing any issues and enhancing the overall user experience. By iterating based on real-world input, the final solution would be better aligned with user needs and expectations.

### Lessons Learned in Class

The class presentations emphasized the importance of gathering user opinions and understanding their needs through effective interviews. I learned that focusing on user experience is key to identifying meaningful solutions. Additionally, the presentations highlighted the value of asking insightful, open-ended questions during interviews to uncover deeper insights into user behavior and preferences. This knowledge reinforced the necessity of tailoring the robot’s design to fit user needs rather than relying solely on assumptions.
