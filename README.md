### **Reflection**

#### **My Role in Each Project**

In `Project 2`, my main role was to come up with ideas and gather data. I helped by conducting interviews and analyzing the feedback to better understand the problems we needed to solve. I also evaluated different solutions and worked on creating ideas for storyboards and wireframes. These wireframes helped visualize how the solution could look and work.

For `Project 3`, my role became a bit more hands-on. I was the person who figure out what needed to be done and worked on designing the problem and the solution, which was an app. I also created wireframes using Figma to show how the app would be structured and designed the final look of the app to make sure it met the needs of the users.

#### **What I Learned from Completing Each Project**

From **Project 2**, I learned how important teamwork is. It’s vital to divide tasks between team members to make sure everything gets done efficiently. I also realized that waiting until the last minute to start work isn’t a good idea. Planning ahead and giving yourself enough time is key. Another important lesson was the value of listening to users’ opinions. Their feedback helped guide the design process and made sure we were solving real problems.

In **Project 3**, I learned even more about the importance of working together with teammates. Discussing ideas and sharing feedback early on helped make the project more successful. I also realized again that getting input from other whether it’s teammates or users is very helpful. Their perspectives allowed me to improve the design and make better decisions.

#### **How My Design Philosophy and Perspective Have Changed**

At the beginning of the course, I thought UI/UX was mostly about making things look good. I believed that if the design looked nice, then it was probably good. But as I worked through the projects, I realized I was underestimating how much goes into designing something effective. It was not only about looking good, but also about having proper purpose, and proper solution. Now, I understand that design isn’t just about looks. It’s about solving problems for the user and making sure the design works well for them. This shift in thinking has changed how I approach every design decision, making me think more about the user and less about just making something pretty.

#### **What I Think UI and UX Is Now**

Now, I understand that UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) are not just about how something looks. They are about why something exists, who it’s for, and how it helps solve a problem. UI/UX is about making products that are useful, easy to use, and pleasant for the user. It’s also about paying attention to small details, because even little things can make a big difference in how users experience a product. Overall, UI/UX is about making thoughtful design decisions that put the user first.
